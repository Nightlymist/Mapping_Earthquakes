# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a map that demonstrates the magnitude of earthquakes relative to the plate tectonic boundaries on computers, laptops, and mobile phones.
 

## Results
The major earthquakes tend to be around the tectonic boundaries with smaller earthquakes are away from the tectonic boundaries. There are filters that can be selected for the all earthquakes, tectonic boundaries, and the major earthquakes with the magnitude 4.5 and up. 

## Summary
To visually demostrate the earthquakes present along with the tectonic boundaries with filters that shows the major earthquakes around the world. Able to show the high magnitude earthquakes relative to the plate tectonic boundaries around the world.
